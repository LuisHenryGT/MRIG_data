# McGill Radiology Interest Group: Pneumonia Detection AI Workshop

## Overview
Welcome to the McGill Radiology Interest Group workshop! In this session, we will guide you through building an AI model that can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays using a Jupyter Notebook environment. This hands-on workshop is designed for beginners with a basic understanding of machine learning and medical imaging, providing you with practical experience in creating an AI model using real-world data.

## Objectives
- Learn how to set up a Jupyter Notebook for AI model development.
- Understand the basics of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application to medical imaging.
- Build, train, and evaluate an AI model for detecting pneumonia on chest X-rays.
- Gain insight into the ethical considerations of AI in radiology.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended via Anaconda or Google Colab)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Internet connection to access data and training resources
